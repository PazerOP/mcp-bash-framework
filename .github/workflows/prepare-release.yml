            ## Summary
            - Bumps `VERSION` to match the requested release version.
            - Re-renders `README.md` from `README.md.in`.

            ## Notes
            - After merging, tag the release (e.g. `vX.Y.Z`) and the `release` workflow will verify `VERSION` and the rendered README.
